# What is Tkl
Tkl is a machine learning platform coded in python, it uses an easy-to-use framework. It's also very lite weight, which means it can run on low-end pc, tablets, phones, etc...



# Why Tkl?
```
Tkl is a very lite weight machine learning libary it runs off the `CPU`. 
*Currently has no support for `GPU`
```

# Try your first Tkl program
```python
from tkl import *
import random


#// setting up the inputs
input1 = NN.add_input(random.uniform(0, 1))
input2 = NN.add_input(random.uniform(0, 1))
input3 = NN.add_input(random.uniform(0, 1))
input4 = NN.add_input(random.uniform(0, 1))

#// setting up the layers  
neuron1 = NN.add_neuron(input1,activations.ReLU,0.0001,alpha=2.0,gamma=-1.2)
neuron2 = NN.add_neuron(input2,activations.ReLU,0.001,alpha=2.0,gamma=-1.2)
neuron3 = NN.add_neuron(input3,activations.ReLU,0.001,alpha=2.0,gamma=-1.2)
neuron4 = NN.add_neuron(input4,activations.ReLU,0.001,alpha=2.0,gamma=-1.2)
#//seting up the outputs

output1 = NN.add_output(neuron1,[1.1,2,-2,1],1)
output2 = NN.add_output(neuron2,[0.2,2,-2,1],1)
output3 = NN.add_output(neuron3,[0.3,2,-2,1],1)

```
